# VisionAid: AI-Powered Cataract Detection

VisionAid is a cataract detection model developed using a CNN deep learning architecture, designed to classify medical images into cataract and non-cataract categories. The model leverages two distinct datasets to improve accuracy and enhance the detection process, providing an effective solution for early cataract diagnosis.

## Features
- Accurate cataract detection using a CNN-based deep learning model
- Trained on over 5,000 medical images for robust performance
- Dataset split: 80% training and 20% validation
- Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model with custom layers, achieving a validation accuracy of 95%
- Efficient image processing for fast and reliable predictions
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for development
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model
- **EfficientNetB0**: For enhanced performance through transfer learning
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and augmentation
- **Google Colab**: For GPU-accelerated model training
- **Flask/Node.js (if applicable)**: For deploying the model in a web-based interface
